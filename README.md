This ReactJS code does nothing spectacular except display random quotes on screen. The CSS styles the blockquote tag but does nothing exceptional otherwise.

The quotes are stored in an array. The pointer to that array, *currentIndex* is stored in the *Quote* class's state. Every time the button is clicked, *stateIndex* is randomized and the text in the ReactDOM changes accordingly. Really simple stuff.
